# CFD Simulation - Beta Version
<div style="background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #e6e600; border-left: 6px solid #e6e600">
The CFD Simulation documentation is in a <b>Beta phase of release</b>. 

The original documentation was based on the svSolver. This solver is no longer supported and is now replaced by
the <a href="https://github.com/SimVascular/svMultiPhysics"> svMultiPhysics </a> solver.

The contents of the documentation are not finalized and could change in the future.

Some sections of the documentation are incomplete and are actively being updated.

# Introduction

The **CFD Simulation Tool** is used to setup and run a computationalal fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the <a href="https://github.com/SimVascular/svMultiPhysics"> svMultiPhysics </a> finite element solver.

In contrast with the <a href="https://simvascular.github.io/documentation/multi_physics.html#sv-fsi-tool"> MultiPhysics Tool</a>, 
the **CFD Simulation Tool** graphical user interface (GUI) provides a simple interface used only to set the physical constants, boundary conditions and solver parameters needed for simulations of blood flow in models of the human vasculature.
