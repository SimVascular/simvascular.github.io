## MITK Framework 

The SimVascular application uses the <a href="https://www.mitk.org/"> Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK)</a>
framework for medical imaging applications incorporating a plugin architecture. Standard <i>MITK</i> tools have been 
incorporated into SimVascular: a graphics display window with three orthographic 2D views and one 3D view, 
image file readers (e.g. DICOM), an image navigator tool for displaying 2D image planes, image processing, and volume rendering.

<i>MITK</i> <i>Tools</i> (e.g. image processing) are not integrated with SimVascular <i>Tools</i>. This means that data created by 
<i>MITK</i> <i>Tools</i> is not accessible from SimVascular <i>Tools</i>. <i>MITK</i> <i>Tools</i> are therefore of limited use in 
the SimVascular modeling pipeline.
