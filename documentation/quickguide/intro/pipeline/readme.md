## Modeling Pipeline

The SimVascular image-based modeling pipeline comprises the following steps

<ol>
  <li> <b>Image visualization</b> - Identify anatomic features in the imaging data </li>
  <li> <b>Path planning</b> - Vessel centerlines geometry is created using 2D image slices to identify vessel lumens </li>
  <li> <b>Segmentation</b> - Vessel lumens are segmented from 2D slice probes of 3D image data oriented perpendicular to positions along paths</li>
  <li> <b>Modeling</b> - A geometric model of a vessel is created by generating a surface fitted to groups of 2D segmentations. Individual
       vessels are then joined together to form a complete 3D solid model of vascular anatomy. </li>
  <li> <b>Meshing</b> - A finite element mesh is generated from the 3D solid model </li>
  <li> <b>Simulation</b> - Perform a finite element computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of blood flow in the vascular anatomy</li> 
</ol> 
<br>

Each step in the pipeline uses data created by the preceding steps. For example, the <i>Segmentation</i> step uses path geometry created
in the <i>Path planning</i> step to position and orient 2D image slices used to segment a vessel lumen.

A visual representation of the pipeline steps (Fig. 1) provides a sense of the (primarily geometric) data created in each step.
