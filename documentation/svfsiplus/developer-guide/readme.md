<h1> Developer Guide </h1>
svFSIplus is an open-source software project hosted on the 
<a href="https://github.com/SimVascular">SimVascular</a> GitHub website. The svFSIplus source code can be 
downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/SimVascular/svFSIplus"> svFSIplus</a> GitHub repository by 
anyone who wants to inspect, modify, and enhance the code. Users can contribute code to the svFSIplus project 
to extend its capabilities; see the <a href="#developer_contribute_code"> Contributing Code </a> section below.

The following sections describe some of the implementation details of the svFSIplus code. This should 
provide a basic understanding of some of the implementation details that will be useful to a developer 
when adding new functionality, fixing bugs and how the solver does what it does.

References will occasionally be made to the implementation of the svFSI Fortran code. This done to
provide the background for understanding certain implementation decisions.
